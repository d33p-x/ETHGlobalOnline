# ✅ DRPC Solution - Real-Time Events Working!

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
Public Base Sepolia RPC (`https://sepolia.base.org`) doesn't support event filters, causing:
- ❌ "filter not found" errors
- ❌ Markets constantly refreshing (polling every 10 seconds)
- ❌ No real-time updates

### The Solution
**Switch to DRPC** - A premium RPC provider with full event filter support!

## New RPC Endpoint
```
https://lb.drpc.live/base-sepolia/AnBo9LCfkk8XiJdvpwEIP-9rwpDFsXUR8LwaQrxF2MGT
```

## How It Works Now

### ✅ Real-Time Updates (No More Polling!)
- **MarketList**: Uses `useWatchContractEvent` for instant market updates
- **SupportedTokens**: Loads once, no polling needed
- **No constant refreshing** - Events only fire when something actually happens!

### Benefits
✅ **Instant updates** - Markets appear immediately when created
✅ **No constant refreshing** - Only updates when events fire
✅ **Better UX** - Smooth, real-time experience
✅ **Works perfectly** - Both on Anvil and Base Sepolia

## Technical Details

### What DRPC Supports (That Public RPC Doesn't)
- ✅ `eth_newFilter` - Create event filters
- ✅ `eth_getFilterChanges` - Poll for filter updates
- ✅ `eth_getLogs` - Better rate limits for historical logs
- ✅ WebSocket support (via `wss://...` endpoint)

### Files Updated
1. `frontend/.env.local` - DRPC RPC URL
2. `frontend/src/app/MarketList.tsx` - Restored `useWatchContractEvent`
3. `frontend/src/app/SupportedTokens.tsx` - Removed polling
4. `contracts/.env` - DRPC RPC for deployment
5. `contracts/.env.example` - Template with DRPC

## How Events Work Now

### MarketList Component
```typescript
// 1. Load historical markets on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchLogs = async () => {
    const logs = await client.getLogs({
      address: p2pAddress,
      event: p2pAbi[0],
      fromBlock: 0n,
      toBlock: "latest",
    });
    setMarkets(parsedMarkets);
  };
  fetchLogs();
}, [client]);

// 2. Watch for NEW markets in real-time
useWatchContractEvent({
  address: p2pAddress,
  eventName: "MarketCreated",
  onLogs(logs) {
    // Add new markets to the list instantly!
    setMarkets([...prevMarkets, newMarket]);
  },
});
```

### Result
- **Initial load**: Fetches all historical markets
- **New markets**: Added instantly via event listener
- **No polling**: Only updates when events actually fire!

## Performance

### Before (Public RPC with Polling)
- ⏱️ 10-second intervals
- 🔄 Constant network requests
- 📊 High bandwidth usage
- 😕 Noticeable UI refreshing

### After (DRPC with Event Filters)
- ⚡ Instant updates
- 🎯 Only when events fire
- 📉 Minimal bandwidth
- 😊 Smooth, no refreshing!

## For Production

### Current Setup (Hackathon)
✅ Using DRPC free tier with API key
✅ Good enough for demo/hackathon
✅ No credit card required

### For Production (Later)
Consider these options:
1. **DRPC Pro** - Higher rate limits, better SLA
2. **Alchemy** - Enterprise-grade, great analytics
3. **Infura** - Reliable, widely used
4. **QuickNode** - Fast, good support
5. **Own Base Node** - Full control, no limits

## Troubleshooting

### If Events Stop Working
1. Check DRPC API key is valid
2. Check rate limits (unlikely with DRPC)
3. Hard refresh browser
4. Check console for errors

### If Markets Don't Load
1. Check contract is deployed on Base Sepolia
2. Verify P2P address in `config.ts` is correct
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try hard refresh

## Summary

🎉 **Everything works perfectly now!**

- Markets load instantly
- Real-time updates without polling
- No constant refreshing
- Professional-grade RPC provider
- Ready for your hackathon demo!
